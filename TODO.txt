XLIFF to HTML converter

Current/next:

Engineering Tasks:
    - do some HTML post-processing to fine-tune tests:
        - convert_local.t shouldn't have to also check that default global rules to prevent inheritance have been added
        - should be able to check XML equality of script elements instead of text equality
    - Test::HTML::Differences is not very good. Would like a module that handles HTML5, properly normalizes all of it and then takes a diff. Even better would be a structural test instead of line-by-line comparison. Also, need to be able to tell it how to compare contents of <script> elements, which tend to vary in non-semantic whitespace, causing test failures.

Later To Do:
    - change the way xpaths are generated for comments, text, etc.; XML::LibXML sometimes gives a path with asterisks, sometimes gives one with element names. This makes testing fragile.
    - pass ITS object to converter, instead of data
        - better dependency injection will make it more flexible
