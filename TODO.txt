##TODO notes for the ITS/WICS packages:

###General TODOs for all parts of the distribution:
    * check test coverage and fill it in!


###ITS

    * submit pull request to XML::LibXML to add unique_key method to Namespace class, then use it in ITS::DOM::Node.
    * use Log::Any
    * Implement ITS inheritance
    * Create a way to specify elements that are inline (INI file? constructor args?)
        - currently the ITS::DOM::Element::is_inline method just checks for a newline before and after.

###ITS-XML2XLIFF
This thing only converts a single sample file provided for the WICS project. There's plenty more work to do:

    * Implement conversion for all of the other metadata categories
    * handle its:span (non-namespaced ITS atts)
    * Implement inheritance in the ITS module and then also transfer inherited ITS to XLIFF trans-units
    * Use withinTextRule to help delineate trans-units in ITS segmentation scheme
    * Put elements matched by targetPointerRule in the same trans-unit, using ITS on the source to annotate the trans-unit where applicable
    * Put its:annotatorsRef somewhere useful
    * Extract translatable attributes
        * how to treat ones marked with withinText=yes?
    * In the custom segmentation scheme, only put inline untranslatable elements in <ph> tags. Use <bpt> and <ept> for inline translatable ones.
    - use Test::XML::Ordered instead of Test::XML, after proper comparison of other types of nodes are added to that distribution.
        - See RT #89262, 89263, 89264
        - this way we only have to install one XML processor (XML::LibXML)
