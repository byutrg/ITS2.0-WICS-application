
Current Task: Update how to create standalone

Future TODO:
    - add new logic for writing to files with other extensions with WICS-GUI.pl
    - rewrite GUI in XRC
    - capture logs with Log::Any::Adapter subclass and Wx::Log subclass, removing timestamps, and printing to thetext box
        - right now we just grab all logs with Log::Any::Test and print them all when the document is done processing
