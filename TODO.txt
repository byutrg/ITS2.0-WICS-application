ITS

Current task:
    - any DOM methods still needed for HTML conversion

Engineering Tasks:

To Do on current task:
    * reorganize code so that you can't call an XML::LibXML::Element sub with an attribute on accident.
    - test is_inline (node)
    - test ITS_atts (node- list atts which are ITS)
    - test remove node
    - test set node name

Later To Do:
    - return array, not array ref, from children()
    - reorganize tests to match split DOM/Node/Value files
    - proper error checking for XPath execution
    - ?enforce value of idValueRule XPath being a string
    - ?enforce pointers being nodes
    - check test coverage and fill it in!
    - rename get_matches and iterate_rules to reflect what is being matched (single rule or all rules)
