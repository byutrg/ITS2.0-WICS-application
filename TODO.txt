WICS XML to HTML converter

Next: Remove all preserveSpace rules.

Engineering Tasks:
    - rewrite GUI in XRC
    - capture logs with Log::Any::Adapter subclass and Wx::Log subclass, removing timestamps, and print text box
        - right now we just grab all logs with Log::Any::Test and print them all when the document is done processing
To Do on current task:

Later To Do:
    - pass ITS object to converters, instead of data
        - better dependency injection will make it more flexible
    - get rid of WICS.pm; remove that package, and place functionality into WICS.pl
    - maybe separate distros:
        - XML::ITS::XML2HTML
        - XML::ITS::XLIFF2HTML
        - XML::ITS::XML2XLIFF
        - XML::ITS::HTMLConsolidate
        - XML::ITS::WICS
            - this last one would depend on all the others, and include scripts/GUI stuff
    - allow specifying log level from command line for WICS.pl
    - find possible code reuse in converter
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - Inject logger
