This thing only converts a single furnished sample file. There's plenty more work to do:

* Implement all of the other metadata categories
* handle its:span (non-namespaced ITS atts)
* Implement inheritance in the ITS module and then also transfer inherited ITS to XLIFF trans-units
* Use withinTextRule to help delineate trans-units
* Put elements matched by targetPointerRule in the same trans-unit, using ITS on the source to annotate the trans-unit where applicable
* Put its:annotatorsRef somewhere useful
* Extract translatable attributes
    * how to treat ones marked with withinText=yes?

- use Test::XML::Ordered instead of Test::XML, after proper comparison of other types of nodes are added.
    - this way we only have to install one XML processor (XML::LibXML)
