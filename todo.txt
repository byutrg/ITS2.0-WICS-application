WICS XML to HTML converter

TODO:

Engineering Tasks:
    * find a way to keep non-element matches after namespace stripping, text wrapping
        - probably need to save element refs instead of elements, and then replace
        them through a central index
        - p = parent, s = sibling, e = element itself
        Special processing required for each category of FutureNode
                _bdo wrap_      _ns replace or TXT FutureNode wrap_
        ELT     no              yes [e]âœ“
        ATT     no              yes [p]
        COM     yes [s]         yes [ps]
        PI      yes [s]         yes [ps]
        TXT     no              no
        NS      yes [s]         yes [ps]
        DOC     no              yes [e]

To Do on current task:

Later To Do:
    - find possible code reuse in converter
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - GUI?
    - Inject logger

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
