XML to HTML converter

TODO:
- create interface for iterating over matches
- then write TODOs for HTML stuff

Engineering Tasks:
    - design XPath querying for rule matches (set contexts correctly)

To Do on current task:
    - test pointer matches with namespaces in scope of selected node
    - test warning for more than one match for a relative selector
    - test behavior for no match for a relative selector
    - find out of parameters are used for relative selectors
Later To Do:
    - get ITS rules by namespace URI, not prefix
    - proper error checking for XPath execution
    - make sure that Rule objects don't store the actual attribute hash used by the XML element
    - Create full storage of Rule XML contents (future proofing and allowing greater extensibility)
        - right now it just lists children tags and text

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
