WICS XML to HTML converter

TODO:

*NEXT THING:
    turn FutureNodes into the complete manager for future nodes. It should track and
    manage the cache. It should use the cache to prevent futureNodes from being created twice.


Engineering Tasks:
    - make FutureNode into a FutureNode manager
        - refactor future_cache into FutureNode package
    - find a way to keep non-element matches after namespace stripping, text wrapping
        - probably need to save element refs instead of elements, and then replace
        them through a central index
        - p = parent, s = sibling, e = element itself
        Special processing required for each category of FutureNode
                _bdo wrap_      _ns replace or TXT FutureNode wrap_
        ELT     no              yes [e]âœ“
        ATT     no              yes [p]
        COM     yes [s]         yes [ps]
        PI      yes [s]         yes [ps]
        TXT     no              no
        NS      yes [s]         yes [ps]
        DOC     no              yes [e]

To Do on current task:
    -add global rules un-doing inheritance, when needed:
        <its:translateRule translate="no" selector="every converted node ID here"/>
        <its:dirRule dir="ltr" selector="converted nodes, except the atts"/>
        <its:localFilterRule localeFilterList="*" localeFilterType="include" selector="converted nodes, except the atts"/>
        <!-- Not for HTML docs, but for others--><its:preserveSpaceRule preserve="default" selector="converted nodes, except the atts">
        - test this with multiple future nodes
    - test multiple matches on one future node

Later To Do:
    - find possible code reuse in converter
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - GUI?
    - Inject logger

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
