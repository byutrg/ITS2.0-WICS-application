XML to HTML converter

TODO:
- create interface for iterating over matches
- then write TODOs for HTML stuff

Engineering Tasks:
    - Test::Base class
        - filters for creating ITS objects with specified rules and applying to given document
    - switch to XML::LibXML

To Do on current task:
    -

Later To Do:
    - make sure that Rule objects don't store the actual attribute hash used by the XML element
    - Create full storage of Rule XML contents (future proofing and allowing greater extensibility)
        - right now it just lists children tags and text

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
