WICS XML to HTML converter

TODO:
    - create HTML match indexer
        * create a 'future-node' class to save match spots

Engineering Tasks:
    - change FutureNodes in matches array when strip_ns changes elements
    - make HTML comparison tests less fragile (whitespace in script element) ?

To Do on current task:
    - test rule conversions
    - special semantics for idValueRule conversion

Later To Do:
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - GUI?
    - Inject logger

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
