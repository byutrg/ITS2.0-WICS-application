TODO:

Engineering Tasks:

To Do on current task:

Later To Do:
    - store owning DOM in FutureNodeManager object, instead of passing it as an arg to create_future()
    - export constructors for FutureNode and FutureNodeManager
    - change LogUtils to be an object
        - give it the logger to log with
        - have it store id_num on a per-instance basis
    - test API of FutureNodeManager
    - find possible code reuse in converter
    - move special log functions into separate class
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - GUI?
    - Inject logger

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
