To Do on current task:

Later To Do:
    - only allow element/attribute matches in selectors
    - correctly report error with default namespace and XPath
        - actually, test all errors and their locations
    - move special log functions into separate class
    - test copying of stuff inside rules (locNote)
    - test APIs of FutureNode and FutureNodeManager
    - find possible code reuse in converter
    - change LogUtils to be an object
        - give it the logger to log with
        - have it store id_num on a per-instance basic
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - GUI?
    - Inject logger

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
