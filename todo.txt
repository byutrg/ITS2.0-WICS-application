XML to HTML converter

TODO:
- create interface for iterating over matches
- then write TODOs for HTML stuff

Engineering Tasks:
    - design XPath querying for rule matches (set contexts correctly)

To Do on current task:
    - Figure out how to get all namespaces in scope with XML::LibXML
        - actually it's fine! Context node gives all scoped namespaces.
        - only need to worry about its and xlink stuff, queried from document node.
    - figure out context size and position and other context stuff

Later To Do:
    - make sure that Rule objects don't store the actual attribute hash used by the XML element
    - Create full storage of Rule XML contents (future proofing and allowing greater extensibility)
        - right now it just lists children tags and text

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
