WICS XML to HTML converter

TODO:

Engineering Tasks:
    * make general FutureNode methods more object oriented
        - FutureNode manager object
    - proper attribute inheritance (Maybe not? [please please please])
        - changes needed in _traversal_sub; also requires new indices and domain logic
            - create attribute FutureNodes whenever the inherited value is different from default. Or not?

To Do on current task:

Later To Do:
    -add global rules un-doing inheritance, when needed:
        <its:translateRule translate="no" selector="every converted node ID here"/>
        <its:dirRule dir="ltr" selector="converted nodes, except the atts"/>
        <its:localFilterRule localeFilterList="*" localeFilterType="include" selector="converted nodes, except the atts"/>
        <!-- Not for HTML docs, but for others--><its:preserveSpaceRule preserve="default" selector="converted nodes, except the atts">
        - test this with multiple future nodes
    - test multiple matches on one future node
    - handle inheritance for attributes
    - move special log functions into separate class
    - test copying of stuff inside rules (locNote)
    - find possible code reuse in converter
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - GUI?
    - Inject logger

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
