XML to HTML converter

TODO:
- create interface for iterating over matches
- then write TODOs for HTML stuff

Engineering Tasks:

To Do on current task:
    - get ITS rules by namespace URI, not prefix

Later To Do:
    - proper error checking for XPath execution
    - enforce value of idValueRule XPath being a string
    - enforce pointers being nodes
    - check test coverage and fill it in!

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
