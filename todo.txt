XML to HTML converter

TODO:
- create interface for iterating over matches
- then write TODOs for HTML stuff

Engineering Tasks:
    - thoroughly test matching
        - need some answers from ITS group, first!

To Do on current task:
    - test pointer matches with namespaces in scope of selected node
    - test warning for more than one match for a relative selector
    - test behavior for no match for a relative selector
    - find out if parameters are used for relative selectors
    - varify that idValue atts are relative selectors (except for return type)
Later To Do:
    - get ITS rules by namespace URI, not prefix
    - proper error checking for XPath execution
    - enforce value of idValueRule XPath being a string
    - enforce pointers being nodes
    - check test coverage and fill it in!

Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
