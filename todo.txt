WICS XML to HTML converter

TODO:
    - transform local ITS markup
    - create HTML match indexer
        - create a 'future-node' class to save match spots
    - Test logging
    - div in a span is illegal. Fix, warn in software or warn in docs?
    - div in bdo similarly (generated with its:dir lro and rlo)

Engineering Tasks:
    - change HTML transform iterator to query each element for children instead of just looping through them with //*
        - so we can avoid changing children of standoff
        - so we can avoid div children of spans and bdos
    - testable logging via Log::Any;

To Do on current task:

Later To Do:
    - Decide on organization of end-project
        - WICS.pm one file that can convert anything?
            - GUI?
            - Inject logger (via Log::Any)?


Testing:
    Besides testing each piece of functionality, we need a comprehensive end-to-end XML2HTML test suite for Renat and Serge
